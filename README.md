This is a hobby application built for practice and fun.  

Panelo is an application that uses the Elo rating system (read more on Elo below) to rank competitors based on a series of one-on-one matchups, considering each competitor's relative strength.

## What is the Elo rating system?
The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in competitor-versus-competitor games such as chess. It is named after its creator Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-born American physics professor.

The Elo system was originally invented as an improved chess rating system. It is commonly used in sports to adjust for strength of schedule and to compare teams from different eras.
